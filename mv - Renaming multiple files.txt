# Renaming multiple files with the mv Command: https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-rename-files-in-linux/
#
# The mv command can rename only one file at a time, but it can be used in conjunction with other commands
# such as find or inside bash for or while loops to rename multiple files.
#
# The following example shows how to use the Bash for loop to rename all .html files in the current directory
# by changing the .html extension to .php

for f in *.html; do
  mv -- "$f" "${f%.html}.php"
done

# Letâ€™s analyze the code line by line:
#
# - The first line creates a for loop and iterates through a list of all files edging with .html
# - The second line applies to each item of the list and moves the file to a new one replacing .html with .php
#   The part ${file%.html} is using the shell parameter expansion to remove the .html part from the filename
# - done indicates the end of the loop segment

sudo apt install rename

Try
rename "extra.test" "" *

Or
rename 's/extra.test//;' *

For
extra.test-eggs.txt -> -eggs.txt

# Alternative
for filename in ./*; do mv "./$filename" "./$(echo "$filename" | sed -e 's/test.extra//g')";  done
