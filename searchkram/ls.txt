ls -lAh
l = Auflistung
A = Alles zeigen, bis auf "." oder ".."
h = For Humans understandable.
-1 = One file per line
-X = Sorted by extension
-t = Ordered by time
-r = reverse order

Weitere:
ls -a
dir (auch bei Windows)

Standard Alias:
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias l='ls -CF'




To get the newest file or directory, use this command:

ls -t | head -1

To get the oldest file or directory, use this command:

ls -t | tail -1




Further examples:

ls -l -t | head -3

Will give you top 3 lines (2 files and the total).

This will just give you the first 2 lines of files, skipping the size line:

ls -l -t | tail -n +2 | head -2

tail strips the first line, then head outputs the next 2 lines.




Selection examples using sed, just for variety:

ls -l | sed -n 2p

Using this alternative, which looks more efficient since it stops reading the input when the required line is printed, may generate a SIGPIPE in the feeding process, which may in turn generate an unwanted error message:

ls -l | sed -n -e '2{p;q}'

I've seen that often enough that I usually use the first (which is easier to type, anyway), though ls is not a command that complains when it gets SIGPIPE.

For a range of lines:

ls -l | sed -n 2,4p

For several ranges of lines:

ls -l | sed -n -e 2,4p -e 20,30p
ls -l | sed -n -e '2,4p;20,30p'
