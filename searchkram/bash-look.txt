cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.bak

PS1="MyTestPrompt> "
#Anstatt "username@hostname:~$" hat man jetzt halt "MyTestPrompt> "

You can use these options in either method – temporarily with the "export" command, or permanently by editing the ~/.bashrc file.

$ export PS1="\e[0;32m[\u@\h \W]\$ \e[0m"
[test@ubuntu1 ~]$ 

Your prompt should have the same text as normal but be colored green.

Here’s a breakdown of the commands:

• \e[ – Begin color changes
• 0;32m – Specify the color code
• [\u@\h \W]\$ – This is the code for your normal BASH prompt (username@hostname Workingdirectory $)
• \e[0m – Exit color-change mode

The first number in the color code specifies the typeface:

• 0 – Normal
• 1 – Bold (bright)
• 2 – Dim
• 4 – Underlined

The second number indicates the color you want:

• 30 – Black
• 31 – Red
• 32 – Green
• 33 – Brown
• 34 – Blue
• 35 – Purple
• 36 – Cyan
• 37 – Light gray

Additionally, if you combine the bright option with a color code, you get a lighter version of that color. For example, if you use color code 1;32, you would get light green instead of the normal green. If you use 1;33, you get yellow instead of brown.
